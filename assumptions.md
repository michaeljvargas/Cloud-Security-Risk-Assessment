# Assumptions and Methodology

This assessment is based on common cloud security misconfiguration patterns documented in industry breach reports, cloud security benchmarks, and enterprise risk assessments. Risk likelihood and impact ratings reflect professional judgment informed by financial services threat models and regulatory considerations.

This project does not rely on live cloud environments or production telemetry and is intended to demonstrate cloud risk analysis methodology.
